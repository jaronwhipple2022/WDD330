    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 10 Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <p>3 types of errors: <br>System<br>Programmer<br>User</p>
        <p>Reference error: when a undefined function or variable is called</p>
        <p>Warning: an error that will not cause the program to crash</p>
        <p>'use strict';  >>> this will help prevent errors and help you to write cleaner code.<br>
        can also embed it to be used in only certain parts of the program.</p>
        <p>Linting tools help to follow coding conventions.</p>
        <p>if (window.holoDeck) {<br>
            virtualReality.activate();}<br> This would only execute if the feature is enabled on the user's device.</p>
        <p> alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked - I didn't know that.</p>
        <p>Using the word 'debugger;' will set a breakpoint in the code... could be very useful for debugging.</p>
        <p>Many different error types are available. (look them up for full list) depends on sitution</p>
        <p>*** Very sinilar to python, Try Error Except blocks can be used to handle errors. ***</p>
        <p> Testing procedure:<br>
            1. Write tests (that initially fail)<br>
            2. Write code to pass the tests<br>
            3. Refactor the code<br>
            4. Test refactored code<br>
            5. Write more tests for new features</p>
        <p>Testing extensions can be installed. (jest is used as an example... Seems a little confusing to use.</p>
